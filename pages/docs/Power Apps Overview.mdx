### What is Power Apps?

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.

### Who uses Power Apps?

App makers/creators. There are three types of apps: canvas, model-driven, and portal.

**Power Apps Studio** - app designer used for building canvas apps. The app designer makes creating apps feel more like building a slide deck in Microsoft PowerPoint.

**App designer** - for model-driven apps lets you define the sitemap and add components to build a model driven app.

**Power Apps Portals Studio** - is a WYSIWYG design tool to add and configure webpages, components, forms, and lists.

******************App users****************** - run apps that you or someone else created and shared with you, in browser or on mobile devices (phone or tablets).

### Canvas, Model-Driven, and Portal Apps

Canvas Apps - start with user experience, crafting a highly tailored interface with the power of a blank canvas and connecting it to your choice of more than 200 data sources. You can build canvas apps for web, mobile, and tablet applications.

************Model-Driven Apps************

Apps that with you r data model - building up from the shape of your core business data and process in the Dataverse to model forms, views, and other components. Model-driven apps automatically generate great UI thatâ€™s responsive across devices. 

**************************Portal Apps -************************** Help you create external-facing websites that allow users outside the organization to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create anview data in Dataverse, or even browse content.

Data is stores in a data source, and you bring that data into your app by creating a connection. The connection uses a specific connector to talk to the data source.

Power Apps has connectors for many popular services and on-premises data sources, including SharePoint, SQL Server, Office 365, Salesforce, and Twitter

A connector may provide tables of data or actions. Some connectors provide only tables, some provide only actions, and some provide broth. Also, your connector may be either a standard or custom connector.
