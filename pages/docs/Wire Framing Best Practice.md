A wireframe is a static low-to-mid fidelity simulation of a product concept, depicting the skeletal framework of a webpage of app. Wireframes provide a clear outline of the page structure, layout, information architecture, and overview. They can be hand-drawn with pen and paper, or digitally using software.

Wire framing is the most efficient way to test and define the candidate journey before moving into the product design process. 

Wireframes are a starting point for the product design process, before iterating into later phases where the user interface will be optimized with color, typography, or iconography.

# Best Practice

## DYOR (do your own research)

Before drafting on paper, you’ll need to conduct base level research to refine the product concept. 

- Who are you creating this app for, and why?
- What problem does your app mean to solve?
- How will your app stand out from your competitors?

## Map Candidate Journey

After researching and answering base level questions, it’s time to map out user flow. User flow refers to the pages, steps, and actions a user needs to take to complete a meaningful goal.

- Which marketing channel will your users be coming from?
- What messaging is required for them to complete a particular task?
- How will you show success and failure states?

The further into product design, the more difficult it becomes to address questions and adapt to user flow. Mapping out your user flow will help you to decipher how many screen you’ll need to produce and the flow you expect the user to flow.

## Choose the right tools

Pen and paper is fine when working alone, working on a bigger team with multiple stakeholders, use digital software so that it can be easily shared. Modern tools at the time of writing are:

- Figma
- Sketch

## Function over form

Avoid being too meticulous when creating wireframes to avoid distraction. Remember wireframes are simply a tool for collecting feedback and approximating what the core features or an app or website could look be. It is not meant for creating a perfect simulation of the final product. Branding, color, iconography, and font work shouldn’t be touched until later phases.

Wire framing in greyscale will omit distractions imposed by color or font work.

# How to wireframe for mobile apps

## Finger-friendly designs

When wire framing for a mobile app, make sure you’re adhering to both iOS and Android platform standards. Check that your art board is set up with the correct ratios.

It’s important to ensure wireframes are conforming to industry standard tap target sizes which are targets that refers to any element on a touchscreen device that a user interacts with. 

The tap target needs to be big enough to accommodate the average size of a fingertip.

### Screen size limitations

Pages with a dense amount of informational content should avoid using collapsible menus know as accordions. This is called “progressive disclosure” where important details can be hidden from within a headline. 

### Mobile interaction conventions

- How will your push notifications be enabled, and how will they be timed?
- How will the users interact with the app while offline?
- How will you encourage your users to allow permission to use the location, camera, or photo access?
- Will declining permission mean users miss out on key parts of the experience?
- How will you convey that message?

# Testing

Obtaining user feedback via user testing is a core goal of wire framing. Testing your mobile app wireframe will allow you to identify any points of friction, decipher the ease of your app experience and gauge whether your screen flow matches up with the candidate’s expectations.
