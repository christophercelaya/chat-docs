## What did we discuss

Today we discussed technical requirements such as identifying specific data types per cell.

## **What work did we do**

We created a new template for an upgraded version of our tracker, now called the "Pipeline."

## **Why did we do this**

We did this to ensure data consistency, prepped UI development for streamline, enhanced user experience by providing appropriate input validation and display formatting.

## **What problem did we solve**

We solved for data consistency, UI development, resolved processing errors within Power Apps, and improved user experience.

## **What potential problems did we prevent from happening**

By simplifying the tracker, we significantly reduced inconsistency and corruption of data processes, performance issues, increased errors, maintenance, service tickets (applicable when help desk), reduced data quality, difficulty in data integration, analysis, and compromised security.

## **What did we improve**

We improved the overall structure, organization, and usability of the tracker. The Pipeline presents essential information more clearly, facilitating better communication and automation flow in the Microsoft App.

## **How we did it**

We reviewed the existing tracker and identified areas for improvement. We removed header titles, optimized naming conventions, eliminated parameter options per column, and assigned data types for each column. We aimed at creating a visually clean and straightforward structure for the Pipeline.

## **What do we know now**

We understand the importance of simplicity and user-friendliness in a tracking tool, and we have a clearer vision of maintaining the Pipeline as we continue to build on top.
